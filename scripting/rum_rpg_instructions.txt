\___________________/

The Ready Up! RPG module is extremely flexible, allowing for an astounding array of talents through ability
combinations. With this flexibility comes the freedom to structure each menu in your own, unique way.
From the order of talents, the name of the talents, the abilities of each talent, and more!

This also means that the configuration required for this module is much more demanding. As opposed to mods that
are hard-coded, RPG reads the data inserted into files. It'll take longer to set up, but it'll also be easier to
edit and make changes and/or additions on the fly.

Don't worry about the effects of removing or adding options. New database entries are automatically created at
this time; However, if the column already exists, it will log the error, but don't worry about that right now.
At some point, when other features have been implemented, I'll take the time to re-work this method.


The samples below show how to properly configure each file.
THE ACCEPTABLE KEYS MAY CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE FINAL WORKING VERSION OF THE MODULE.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG

This is the main config file. Edit these appropriately, because some of these values you probably don't want to
change without doing a hard reset (such as "experience start?" and "requirement multiplier?"
However, some you can change freely without causing an imbalance.




"config"
{
	"max level?"				"50"		// The max player level.
	"experience start?"			"10000"		// Experience Lv.1 players must achieve for Lv.2.

	"rpg type?"				"1"		// If 0, players earn talent points for reaching experience cap, leveling. If 1, players spend exp to both level up and purchase ability upgrades.

}




../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/MAINMENU.CFG

This is the main menu that appears to players when they type the !rpg (not yet configurable, re: future update)
Realize that the phrases on the left must be added to your ../TRANSLATIONS/RUM_RPG.PHRASES.txt




"Main Menu"
{	// Translation Name	// Menu / Action Target
	"Survivor Talents"	"rpg/survivormenu.cfg"
	"Infected Talents"	"rpg/infectedmenu.cfg"
	"Passive Abilities"	"rpg/passivesmenu.cfg"	// I actually think this menu is deprecated (in the base version, at least)
	"level up"		"level up"		// This command targets the level up option.
	"Sky Store"		"rpg/skystore.cfg"
	"EOM"			"EOM"			// This line must exist at the end of your menu.
}




../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/EVENTS.CFG

Every key (left) and value (right) isn't required. It's up to you to check the above link to determine what is and
what is not necessary. Explaining these aren't necessary as they're explained on the wiki.
Again, the EOM line is REQUIRED.

Talent Example:




"Survivor Health"						// The TALENT name (as it appears in the database and the translation name for ../TRANSLATIONS/RUM_RPG.phrases.txt)
{
	"increase per point?"			"0.03"		// The amount of health increase (percentage) a player has per point in this talent.
	"maximum talent points allowed?"	"50"		// The amount of talent points that can be placed in this category.
	"first point value?"			"0.03"		// The value that the first point of a talent is worth.
	"accompanied by?"			"none"		// Not currently used.
	"cooldown per point?"			"0.0"		// The amount of time (in seconds) that must pass between activations of this ability; rises with each point in the ability. 0.0 Disables.
	"cooldown start?"			"-1.0"		// If -1.0, cooldown per point increases cooldown, otherwise cooldown per point subtracts from this value. If total cooldown is < 0.1, plugin will failstate and stop.
	"class required?"			"0"		// 0 - survivor, 1 - smoker, 2 - boomer, 3 - hunter, 4 - spitter, 5 - jockey, 6 - charger, 8 - tank (Ex: 12 = smoker, boomer)
	"ability active time?"			"0.0"		// How long the ability is active (in seconds), if it's an over-time ability.
	"ability active range?"			"0.0"		// The range (in game units) the abilities effects reach for affected players during its active time.
	"restricted by level?"			"1"		// Is there a restriction to how many talent points can be spent based on the players level?
	"talent points per level?"		"2"		// How many talent points can be spent based on player level? Ex. if 2, and Lv. 4, a player can spend 8 points in the category.
	"minimum level required?"		"0"		// If a minimum required level is set, the value is subtracted from the players level to calculate talent points per level (if enabled).
	"survivor ability effects?"		"e"		// The effects that affect survivor players targeted by this ability. 0 ignores.
	"infected ability effects?"		"0"		// The effects that affect infected players targeted by this ability. 0 ignores.
	"weapons permitted?"			"ignore"	// Ignore - Ignores field. All - All weapons. Otherwise, separate allowed weapons with commas.
	"passive or aggressive?"		"passive"	// Passive (affects the perpetrator) or Aggressive (affects the perpetrator's target)
	"ability trigger?"			"0"		// What type of trigger is required to activate this ability? 0 means it is ALWAYS active.
	"victim lower level penalty?"		"0.0"		// The penalty instated against the aggressor if the player is a lower level (this also applies to same-team abilities for balance.)
	"victim lower level ignored?"		"0"		// How many levels below the aggressor must a target be for this ability to do nothing to them (this also applies to same-team abilities for balance.)
	"victim higher level award?"		"0.0"		// The bonus per level above the aggressor of the victim to increase its effectiveness (this does not apply to same-team abilities for balance.)
	"ability type?"				"0"		// Not currently used.
	"passive effects?"			"e"		// The passive effects that this ability grants WHEN active.
	"ability inherited?"			"1"		// If 0, the ability must be unlocked, either through sky points or loot drops.
	"store purchase cost?"			"0"		// If inherited is 0, the cost to buy from the sky store.
	"origin based?"				"0"		// If it's area effect or range-based, if it starts at the client, target, or is ignored (0) ?
	"team affected?"			"victim"			// client (aggregator) victim (target) both (both players)
}





You must provide an "ability trigger?" for survivor / infected ability effects to fire.
"passive effects?" are always active (based on their criterion of course.)
However, survivor / infected ability effects can have more than one effect, but MUST have at least one.

Example:

"survivor ability effects?"	"st"	// The target (if survivor, or the player who used it if survivor and "team affected?" is "both") of the ability will be both slowed and have spit dropped on them. Geeze.
"infected ability effects?"	"bB"	// The target (if infected, or the player who used it if infected and "team affected?" is "both") of the ability will both be bean bagged and blinded. Ouch.
