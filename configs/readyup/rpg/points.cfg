// You can have submenu within submenu. I've finally added this feature.
// This means you could have the "weapons" menu option (which opens a submenu because the command has ":" at the start
// and then inside of the "weapons" menu, create a menu submenu, for example, called "other weapons"
// However, it's important to understand that there is no "back" option for these menus, so if you want to create an
// option for players to return to a previous menu, you'll need to manually create that, even if it looks silly, because
// it'd be a duplicate of another option.
