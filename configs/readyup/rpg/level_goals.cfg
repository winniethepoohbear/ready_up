// Leveling goals exist to reward players for investing time on the server.
// You can set how many store points they earn for reaching a level, as well as how many they earn as an added bonus for being one of the first to reach it.
// The "global" category covers ALL players who have played on the server, so it will actually cross-reference the database to see if a player qualifies.
// If the number of qualifying players doesn't exceed the limit, it'll tell the players in the server how many can still earn the bonus goal.
