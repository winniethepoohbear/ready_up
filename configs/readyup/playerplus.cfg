	"actual survivors required?"				"1"			// The number of survivors that must exist (humans + bots). (-1) no bots, ever. (0) humans + bots = survivor limit. (num) humans + bots = value
	"require human survivors?"					"1"			// Are human survivors required for survivor bots to exist? Maps will not advance if this is true, if no humans are in the server.
	"survivor bots balance teams?"				"0"			// Do survivor bots balance the teams? Ex. 4 human survivors, 6 human infected. 2 survivor bots would be created.
	"enforce balanced teams?"					"0"			// Do we enforce balanced teams? If yes, when a player disconnects, player plus will attempt to balance both teams. Otherwise, it'll make sure there's a human survivor.
	"teams panel on teamselect?"				"0"			// Do we show players a team panel after they've selected a team?
